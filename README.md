Singularity image for [R].

This is still a work in progress.

## Build

You can build a local Singularity image named `singularity-r.sif` with:

```sh
sudo singularity build singularity-r.sif singularity.def
```

## Deploy

Instead of building it yourself you can download the pre-built image from
[Singularity Hub](https://www.singularity-hub.org) with:

```sh
singularity pull singularity-r.sif library://nickjer/singularity-r
```

## Run

### R

The `R` command is launched using the default run command:

```sh
singularity run singularity-r.sif
```

or as an explicit app:

```sh
singularity run --app R singularity-r.sif
```

Example:

```console
$ singularity run --app R singularity-r.sif --version
R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10) -- "Kick Things"
